# HOMEWORK # 2

**Objective:** This homework exercise is intended to give you first-hand experience in building a repo for a DS project aligned with current best practices and to help you understand the logic behind best practices. If you need a refresher, check the slides for [week 3](https://github.com/marco-morales/QMSS-GR5069_Spring2022/tree/main/week_03) and [week 4](https://github.com/marco-morales/QMSS-GR5069_Spring2022/tree/main/week_04).

### Instructions:

#### (a) select a project and push it to this repo

* choose a project of your own that you have produced in the past: *e.g*  a homework or a final project for another class
* `push` all files from that project to this repo without changing it. (Note that GitHub is not designed to store data and thus cannot store large files.)

#### (b) add a collaborator

* check the list [**here**](img/homework-2-assignments.png) to find your randomly assigned partners for this homework. You will appear as the owner of this repo with an associated collaborator. You will also appear as a collaborator for someone else's repo
* ask to be added as a collaborator to your designated owner's repo
* add your collaborator to this repo

#### (c) create pull requests for the repo you are a collaborator for

* create **one `pull` request per issue** you identify as subject to improvement. Note that the pull request should include the substantive change you are proposing for the repo. Note that you will not receive full marks is you do not add the change itself.
* in your pull requests explain **why you are recommending specific changes** and **how do you perceive it might help** the you of the future. Note that you will not receive full marks if you do not add these explanations.
* create at least five (5) pull requests to **improve the structure of the project** [`20 pts`]
    * these could include - but are not limited to -  enhancements to the folder structure, adding an informative `README` file, adding items to the `.gitignore` file, dropping data folders, etc
* create at least seven (7) pull requests to **improve coding etiquette** [`40 pts`]
    * these could include - but are not limited to - reorganizing script structure, improving comments, using relative paths, improving readability, creating (and calling) additional scripts, etc



#### (d) act on all pull requests from your collaborator [`40 pts`]

* you will receive multiple `pull` requests from your collaborator with suggestions on how to adopt best practices in your repo
* use the pull request functionality in GitHub to **accept**, **comment** or **reject** each one of these pull requests.
* note that you will not receive full marks if you leave pull requests unattended.
